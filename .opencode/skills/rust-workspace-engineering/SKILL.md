# Rust Workspace Engineering

## Toolchain

Use `just` for routine checks. Nix remains supported for provisioning the pinned Rust toolchain. Prefer focused checks during RGR and `just ci` for the aggregate routine gate.

## Code Conventions

- No `unwrap()` or `expect()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Use `?`, `anyhow::Context`, or explicit error variants.
- Use `read_non_empty_env(name)` and `parse_env::<T>(name)` in `ar-gateway/src/main.rs`.
- Cap provider error bodies with `ar_llm::cap_for_error` or equivalent helpers.
- Keep crate boundaries aligned with `AGENTS.md` and `docs/CRATES.md`.

## Tests

Pure helpers get adjacent unit tests. HTTP integrations use `wiremock`. LLM behavior uses `CannedProvider` or `ScriptedProvider` fakes.

## User-Facing Changes

Use conventional commit titles for user-facing or operator-facing behavior; the release PR generates changelog notes from conventional commits.
